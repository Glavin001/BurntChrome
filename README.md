3. To load your extension in Chrome, open up [`chrome://extensions/`](chrome://extensions/) in your browser and click “Developer mode” in the top right. Now click “Load unpacked extension…” and select the extension’s directory. You should now see your extension in the list.

 When you change or add code in your extension, just come back to this page and reload the page. Chrome will reload your extension. I recommend that you install [`Extensions Reloader`](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/extensions-reloader/fimgfedafeadlieiabdeeaodndnlbhid).

4. Load a webpage in Chrome
